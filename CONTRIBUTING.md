# Contribution guidelines

## Getting started

First off, we would like to thank you for taking the time to contribute and make this a better project!

Here we have a set of instructions and guidelines to reduce misunderstandings and make the process of contributing as smooth as possible.

We hope this guide makes the contribution process clear and answers any questions you may have.

### Language

Please, while contributing or interacting in any way in this project, refrain from using any language other than **English**.

#### For native English speakers

Try to use simple words and sentences. Don't make fun of non-native English speakers if you find something wrong about the way they express themselves.

Try to encourage newcomers to express their opinions, and make them comfortable enough to do so.

### Code of Conduct

We expect that project participants to adhere to our Code of Conduct. You can check the [full text](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you may understand the kind of conduct we are expecting and what actions will and will not be tolerated. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## How can I help?

Here are some ways you can help along with some guidelines.

### Documentation

As a user of our project, you're the perfect candidate to help us improve our documentation!

Typos, errors, lack of examples and/or explanation and so on, are just some examples of things that could be fixed and/or improved.

While documenting, try to keep things simple and clear.

### Issues

Some issues are created with missing information, without a template, not reproducible, or plain
invalid. You can make them easier to understand and resolve.

#### Submitting an issue

- Please search for similar issues before opening a new one;
- Use one of the corresponding issue templates;
- Use a clear and descriptive title;
- Include as much information as possible by filling out the provided issue template;
- Most of the time, the best way to report an issue is a failing test proving it.

### Feedback

The more feedback the better! We're always looking for more suggestions and opinions on discussions. That's a good opportunity to influence the future direction of this tool. This includes submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

### Code

Code help is appreciated! You can use issue labels to discover issues you could help out with.

When you see an issue that is already assigned, please check to see if there isn't someone working on it already (maybe try asking in the issue). This is to prevent unnecessary work for everyone involved.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork and clone the repository;
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`;
3. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass;
4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request;
5. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Follow standards for style and code quality.
- Write tests (if applicable).
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
- Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
